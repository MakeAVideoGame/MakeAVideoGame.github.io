## Results
MAVG will become a game development network, where newbies can come in and gain some experience by working on small tasks or actual projects. We will start creating small projects like "Flappy Birds" with small code gaps. We will also write a guide on how to fill that gap and might provide a sample solution to the problem/task/gap. Someone who wants to learn about game development can then work on this task using the guide and the project framework. At the end everyone can compare solutions in the subreddit /r/MakeAVideoGame.
Once we have more active participants other people can post their projects and tasks with accompanying guide for newbies to complete. When this stage is reached we can start to shift our focus from creating new sample projects towards managing the projects other people are posting, and thereby create a self-sustaining community.
As a direct result of this meeting a new github organization, named [MakeAVideoGame](https://github.com/MakeAVideoGame) and [Website](https://makeavideogame.github.io/) was created.
